#Gave me a warning that Quartz environment runs on python so whether I would like to initiate base conda environment on startup - I chose yes! 


#If you ever need to update conda, type the following command. Beneficial to do at startup. 

conda update -n base conda

# install sra-tools (only need to do this once)

conda install -c bioconda sra-tools

# create rnaseq environment (only need to do this once)

conda create -n rnaseq -c conda-forge -c bioconda entrez-direct sra-tools fastqc seqtk star samtools subread

#to list condaa environments, this keeps changinging fyi
conda info --envs

# activate environment

conda activate rnaseq

#Proceed to alignment of reads
