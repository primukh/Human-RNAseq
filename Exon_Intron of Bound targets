#link to get the basic gene annotation file from gencode. Try for the latest from the website. Also, basic gene annotation file since reads can map to multiple introns/exons depending on different isoforms so mapping becomes tricky. 
#Basic gene annotation assumes the longest isoform for that given gene. We use comprehensive annotation for bound targets but in that case, each read is aligned to a gene and not the isoforms so doesnt matter.
